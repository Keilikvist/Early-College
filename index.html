      <h2>What is Advanced Academics?</h2>
      <p>
        The Aldine ISD Advanced Academics program is for students who are highly
        motivated, possess college-bound behavior, and are capable of performing
        at a high academic level. Advanced Academics includes courses, programs,
        assessments, services and supports that provide opportunities for
        students to demonstrate college and career readiness and earn
        postsecondary credit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced Academics courses include Honors at the middle school and high
        school levels as well as Advanced Placement, Dual Credit with Lone Star
        College and University of Texas OnRamps courses for high school
        students. These courses provide students with opportunities to develop a
        strong foundation by exploring a subject in greater depth and developing
        skills, habits of mind, and concepts needed to succeed in college
        preparatory coursework. Advanced students can expect more independent
        learning and more homework than a regular class. Students and parents
        are required to sign and abide for the Aldine ISD Advanced Academics
        Commitment Form.
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage ALL students to consider taking Advanced Academics courses,
        there are many to choose from for multiple interest areas. When
        considering which courses to take, keep in mind prior grades in that
        subject area, STAAR and EOC scores, as well as personal education and
        career goals. School counselors can help answer any questions about
        course availability and placement for students and parents.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Consider Advanced Academics?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Taking a rigorous curriculum in high school is the best predictor of
          students’ ability to complete a bachelors’ degree (Answers in the
          Toolbox, 1999).
        </li>
        <li>
          The number and quality of advanced courses a learner takes is more
          significant than GPA or class rank for predicting college success.
        </li>
        <li>
          Students taking more advanced courses score about 2.4 points higher on
          the ACT composite than students taking standard graduation plan
          courses (ACT High School Profile, 2005).
        </li>
        <li>
          Students taking Advanced Placement (AP) courses in high school have
          higher GPAs in college than students who do not take AP Courses
          (Answers in the Toolbox, 1999).
        </li>
        <li>
          Learners who have taken AP courses generally score higher on the SAT
          than learners who have not taken AP courses.
        </li>
        <li>
          The number of advanced courses a learner takes in high school may be a
          factor considered by a college when making admission decisions.
        </li>
